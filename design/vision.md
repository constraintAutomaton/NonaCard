# Vision

To create an "Otaku business card" and a map of favorite "Otaku thing" (Anime, Manga, Video game, art). The application must first present a simple presentation of the favorite of the user. When clicking around, the design must evolve to show more information about the user and the media. The information must come from an API. The user can custom the information, present, why he loves it, provide custom images, videos, descriptions, information, etc. Customization by the user is an essential part of the app. The ability to trace the pieces of information about the media is also an important part. For an aspect of a community, testing a concept and reduce the cost, the database must be P2P without compromising the private information of the user and the integrity of the data.
